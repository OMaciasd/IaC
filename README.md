# IaC: Update scripts for any project as cloud repositories!

### Description.

- Hi, I built many scripts for the DevOps phase, within the software lifecycle with deployment for Infrastructure as Code. That you can update any changes to one or more repositories from your respective subscription in the cloud tenant with IaaS, PaaS and SaaS.


## Requirements.

- Have a tenant account or cloud provider subscription.
- Have a local computer for the compilation of YAML, TF, JSON manifests (CloudFormation, Terraform, Docker, Azure CLI)
- Create or clone a project with repositories and modules, using a base structure to standardize.


## Tutorial.

- Clone or build a repository on the platform you use or like, or on your local computer, in the development environment.
- Synchronize each repository with its respective global for pull changes.
- Build the yml file for each repository.
- Install the IaC client, such as the cloud provider's CLI.
- Log in to the cloud provider's platform of the DevOps phases of the Deploy lifecycle.
- Upload new changes.
- Evaluate the lifecycle of each script in the workflow and deploy as a trigger, just like the inputs, outputs, loops, modules, and fileconfig.
